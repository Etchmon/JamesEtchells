        Hey there, my name is James Etchells as you can probably tell by now. I
        have 2 years of experience in frontend development as a contract worker,
        and have received a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from UCSD
        Extension. I have a passion for learning and continue to teach myself
        new skills and technologies, with a special place in my heart for IT
        hardware and Linux.
      </p>
      <p className="text-md md:text-base mt-4 w-full leading-normal text-frost-3">
        Since gaining experience as a frontend developer, I desire to work with
        more areas within the tech industry and learn as much as I can. One way
        I do this one my own is with my HomeLab that I built out of old pc
        parts. I leverage the power of VM's and Docker Containers with a Proxmox
        server to test out new technologies, host my own personal cloud storage
        and media server, and run docker containers to create vpn tunnels and
        reverse proxies to keep my network secure.
      </p>
      <p className="text-md md:text-base mt-4 w-full leading-normal text-frost-3">
        The perfect addition to your dev team!
